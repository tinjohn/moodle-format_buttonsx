Moodle Course Format "Buttonsx"
===============================

Buttonsx is a course format based on the [Buttons format](https://moodle.org/plugins/format_buttons) that creates a menu with buttons per section to access the sections, one by one with the additional opportunity to group sections.
Buttonsx adds an optional menu at the bottom of site / at the end of a section and enables optional hiding of h5p icons and links.

Features of the Buttons Format
-------------------------------
* Create groups of sections, to separate topics in modules or periods;
* Create names to the groups to identify them. (Example: First Semester, Topics about a specific theme);
* Change the colors of the buttons (when active, inactive, on over and hidden), to fit it your Moodle theme;
* Select the list-style in numbers, alphabet or roman numeral.

Additional Features by the Buttonsx Format
--------------------------------------------
* Arrow navigation at the bottom
* Option to hide h5p icons and links in the non editing mode (use case: h5p is embedded in it's own description, thus is not hide-able, result shows icon, link and h5p activity)
